                                    The project that I had put the most amount of work into this academic year was my
                                    Software Design Project course. We were assigned groups of four and we had to make a
                                    Venn diagram tool that would allow the user to create Venn diagrams and check their
                                    answers using an answer key. I love working on font-end, so I was very excited to
                                    get started on this project. I had many ideas on what I what I wanted the user
                                    interface to look like, which made this project feel more fun rather than some
                                    assignment I had to do for a class. I am very proud of the final result as we ended
                                    up adding more features than we anticipated, making the project look more
                                    professional and intuitive.

                                    The purpose of this assignment was to create a back of the napkin video
                                    that explain an engineering topic of my choice. I decided to create a video where I
                                    explained what web APIs are and some of their applications. I thought that I would
                                    be very uncomfortable with drawing and explaining my topic, but surprisingly I
                                    really enjoyed creating this video. I found that explaining what a web API is was
                                    much easier when I was able to create exactly what I was imagining, rather than
                                    finding an image that was only slightly similar. Being able to create my own
                                    drawings has also allowed me to utilize different metaphors to explain complex ideas
                                    about APIs, making it easier for the viewer to digest the information. Overall, this
                                    assignment has taught me to be more creative when it comes to communicating my ideas
                                    and that I should think outside the box more often to present information.

                                    Out of all the projects I have completed this semester, the report assignment was by
                                    far the most difficult for me. I found that it was very difficult to put my thoughts
                                    and ideas to words, making it difficult for me to meet the six pages requirement.
                                    The purpose of the report was to inform the reader of a new emerging technology that
                                    would solve one of the Global Health Priorities, and my topic was augmented reality
                                    and its applications in health care. I feel like this assignment was my most
                                    improved as I created many drafts and continued to make changes. The feedback I
                                    received on this assignment was very beneficial as I had different people’s
                                    perspectives on my writing style.

                                    This assignment required us to research a technology of our choice and then present
                                    the information on a poster to experts on the topic. It was very nerve racking to
                                    try and figure out how to write the information in a way that would intrigue an
                                    audience of experts. I decided to make it more colourful with a dark background to
                                    make it minimalistic and simple, while still keeping the eye catching qualities of a
                                    poster. This poster made me understand how my choice of words and pictures would
                                    help me communicate to different audiences.

                        Lassonde School of Engineering at York University. After taking a computer science class in high
                        school, I have been very passionate about anything software related. As a Software Engineering
                        student with experience in creating web applications and text based adventure games, I am very
                        interested in learning new ways to improve UI and Web Design to my projects. I have experience
                        with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, RISC-V, Verilog, C and bash scripting.
                        <p class="lead">
                            Some of my hobbies include reading, playing video games, design and skateboarding. A design
                            project that I put a lot of work into during my spare time is this website actually! I
                            worked
                            really hard on picking an aesthetically pleasing colour and making sure the website flows
                            nicely. I feel like my passion for design has allowed me to have a better understanding of
                            frontend development, giving me a better understanding of how user interface should be
                            created.

                        The class Effective Engineering Communication had taught many different ways to communicate with
                        my audience through different interactive exercises. These exercises emphasized the importance
                        of effective communication and gave real life applications about when these communication
                        methods would be used. This gave me more motivation to try and understand the content and to
                        apply it to my everyday life. One specific lesson that stuck with me was the email writing
                        lecture. I never really knew when it was appropriate to CC or BCC someone, so im glad I now know when it is appropriate to do so. I was
                        also glad to learn about email writing etiquette as I always got nervous when sending emails.
                        Overall, my time in ENG2003 has taught me a lot of things that are easily applicable to my
                        everyday life.
                        <p class="lead">
                            Throughout the course of this semester, I have noticed that the way I interact with has
                            changed. At the beginning of this course, my writing never had a target audience. For
                            example, we had an assignment at the beginning of the year that required us to create a
                            <a data-toggle="modal" target="_blank" href="#portfolio-modal-10" style="color: #780f0f;">poster</a> and a handout for a target audience. I struggled to find the right words to put on my
                            poster and handout, so I ended up taking a lot longer than I anticipated to finish that
                            assignment. As time progressed and I saw more examples, I began to understand how to write
                            to specific audiences. This was evident when I created my<a data-toggle="modal"
                                target="_blank" href="#portfolio-modal-8" style="color: #780f0f;"> back
                            of the napkin video</a> and noticed that I was able to explain more complicated concepts in
                            a way that was more easily digestible. Because of all of the examples and attempts at
                            writing
                            to a targeted audience, I was able to focus more on creating the drawing part of the video,
                            allowing me to have more fun creating it. I also noticed a difference in my body language at
                            the end of the semester.
                            I am now more aware of how I present myself when listening to someone. I now put away all my
                            devices and lean forward slightly to show the other person that I am listening. I know that
                            I will always use the different communication methods outside the classroom because I now
                            realize how important it is to communicate effectively.
